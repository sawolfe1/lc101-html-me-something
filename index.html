            Hi! My name is Yoshi! I am a Golden Retirever and my master is Scott. <br>
            During the course of a day, I spend my time doing a range of activities. <br>
            Below are a few of my favorite.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Chewin' My Bone</h3>
            First and foremost, my favorite activity of all is gnawing on my USDA select, grade "A" femur bone.<br>
            This chunk of deliciousness is covered in red meat and filled with tasty bone marrow.<br>
            I do my best to gulp up all the meat I can, and when I get tired I bury my bone.<br>
            My bone means a lot to me, so I make sure to bury it where no one can find it. Woof! Woof!<br>
         </p>
         <p>
           <h3>Barkin' At The Neighbors</h3>
            Another one of my favorite activites is make sure my master knows I'm patrolling the yard.<br>
            I do this by barking at the neighbors every chance I get, even late at night.<br>
            I take my job very seriously and I can sound pretty fierce. Woof! Woof!<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>Diggin' Up The Yard</h3>
            Finally, I love to dig moles up out of the yard and chew em' up.<br>
            These pesky rodents like to sneak into my yard when they think no one is paying attention.<br>
            Little do they know, my nose can pick up their scent.<br>
            When I get the scent of one of these pests, I can easily locate and dig em up.<br>
            With a side of dirt, they really make a great meal! Woof! Woof!<br>
